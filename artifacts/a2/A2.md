| BR01       | Privacy | Events can be either public or private. If a event is private, it should not appear to non-invited users on their search results. |
| BR02       | Administrator Accounts | These type of accounts are independent of the other user accounts, meaning they cannot create or participate in events, only moderate them.                                 
| BR03       | Ownership | Only an User that is authenticated is allowed to perform operations on events, like creating or managing their events.|
| BR04       | Creation Date        | Users cannot create an event that the planned date is earlier than the current date.      |
| BR05 | User Deletion | When a User account is deleted, all the events that he was currently managing (without transfering the ownership of the event first) will be deleted, sending a warning message to all the attendees. All its comments and reviews shall stay on the system. | 
| BR06 | Self-Interactions | An User should be able to vote and comment on their own stories/answers, but not review itself.|
